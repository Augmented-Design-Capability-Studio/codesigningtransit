# Co-Designing the Future of Transit

This research project aims to explore and shape the future of transit in an era increasingly influenced by automation technologies. While promising, the introduction of automated vehicle technology presents significant operational and safety challenges, especially in the intricate and unpredictable realm of public transit. Our research emphasizes that despite advancements in automation, skilled human operators will remain indispensable for navigating complex environments and ensuring passenger safety.

In collaboration with the [AFL-CIO Technology Institute](https://aflciotechinstitute.org), the [Transport Workers Union of America](https://www.twu.org), and the [Amalgamated Transit Union](https://www.atu.org), our work aims to co-design future transit by directly engaging people on the frontline: bus operators and riders.

Our research seeks to inform and influence policy and practice and strives to create a just, safe, and efficient future for public transit, where technology complements and enhances human work rather than replaces it. By directly engaging with those who operate and use public transit, we aim to co-design systems that leverage technological advancements and prioritize human experience and societal well-being.

Through this project, we aim to:

- Deepen understanding of the potential impacts of high-level automation on public transit, focusing on bus operators’ roles, responsibilities, and well-being.
- Foster participatory design processes, engaging front-line workers and transit riders in developing future transit systems.
- Evaluate the integration of driver assistance automation technologies and their influence on operator workload, safety, and passenger experience.
- Advocate for proactive measures in policy, training, and infrastructure to prepare for the transition toward increased automation in transit operations.
- Develop recommendations for policymakers, focusing on the implications of automation on transit work, safety regulations, and data-driven oversight of automated transit operations.
